# Ollama-Running-DeepSeek-R1-Locally


# RAG-Based Document Q&A System

A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Streamlit that enables intelligent document querying and answering.

## 🚀 Features

### Document Processing
- Multi-PDF file upload support
- Text extraction using PyMuPDFLoader
- Smart text chunking (400 characters with 100 character overlap)

### Vector Storage
- Implements Chroma DB for vector storage
- Ollama-based text embeddings
- Persistent storage with metadata and unique IDs
- Data stored at './demo-reg-chroma'

### Query Processing
The system processes queries through three main steps:
1. Vector database search for relevant content
2. Similar document retrieval
3. Answer generation using deepseek-r1 language model

### User Interface
